# Beehive_habitat_suitability
This study, conducted on the island of Montreal, Canada, aimed to i) assess honeybee colony survival within an urban environment, ii) determine the primary drivers affecting honeybee colony survival, and iii) explore the potential of urban areas to support beekeeping activities. This study applied two distinct survival analysis methods, namely random survival forests (RSF) and time-dependent Cox models, incorporating both static and dynamic geospatial variables including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), digital elevation model (DEM), percentages of urban areas and water, floral source diversity, road density, proximity to roads, surrounding hive count, ozone (Oâ‚ƒ) concentration, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels, maximum temperature, and precipitation.
